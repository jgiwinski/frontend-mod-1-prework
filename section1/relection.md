## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* I already do a decent job of taking breaks when needed. I know myself well enough that if I'm not understanding something or I'm getting frustrated with a concept then it's time to get up from the desk. My go to break activities are walking the house, doing pushups, finding a snack, or talking to a roommate - just anything to shakeup my brain a bit and then I return to my work. Ususally after a small break I'm able to figure out what I was stuck on almost immediately.  
* I have recently been more diligent about taking care of my brain. I eat fairly healthy (COVID really turned me into an at home chef) and I am very adament about working out/hiking at least 3 times a week. It helps to live in a house with roommates who have the same mindset!
* One of the points that really called me out was the first one: Super learners read a lot. I am not a fan of reading. I have read a total of *maybe* 3 books in the last 6 years. I struggle to stay focused, my mind drifts, and I'm slightly dyslexic so reading has always been a challenge. It is something I am aware I've been stubborn about and I'm working to change that. After reading that section of the article really made me think more about how I need to just force myself to sit down and read more. 
* Another point I know I will be working on more is understanding that learning is a process and will take time. I can't rush myself or be disappointed if I don't catch on to concepts as fast as others might. Everyone has a different learning style and speed. I have to understand that sometimes I can be a little slower and the process might take longer, but I will eventually get there. Need to learn to celebrate the small wins and to be less self-critical. 

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`consol.log("Hello World!")` 

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
